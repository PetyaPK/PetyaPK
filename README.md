# Hi there, I'm Petya! 👋

🌱 **Aspiring Developer | Student at SoftUni | Former Geologist**

---

I'm Petya, and I'm at the very start of my programming journey! After more than 10 years as a geologist and a wonderful pause for motherhood, I'm diving into the world of **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **UI/UX design**. My goal: become a confident web developer and designer over the next two years — with the amazing support of [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/).

## 👩‍💻 What I'm Learning

- **JavaScript** (my main focus!)
- HTML & CSS
- Fundamentals of UI/UX design

## 📚 Why Programming?

Motherhood inspired me to pursue something new and exciting. I love learning and creating, and coding feels like the perfect blend of challenge and creativity!
